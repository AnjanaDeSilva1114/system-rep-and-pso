# Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9 or Higher: Essential for running the Python-based application.
pip: The Python package installer, used for managing Python packages.
Setting Up a Virtual Environment
Using a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies for your project. This ensures that your project's dependencies are kept separate from your system-wide Python packages.
