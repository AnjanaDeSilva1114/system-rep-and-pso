## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9 or Higher: Essential for running the Python-based application.
- pip: The Python package installer, used for managing Python packages.
### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
Using a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies for your project. This ensures that your project's dependencies are kept separate from your system-wide Python packages.

### To run an IPython Notebook (.ipynb file), you can use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Here are step-by-step instructions:
Using Jupyter Notebook:
#### Install Jupyter Notebook:
If you haven't installed Jupyter Notebook, you can install it using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
' pip install notebook '
#### Navigate to the Directory:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your .ipynb file is located.
#### Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Type the following command in the terminal or command prompt and press Enter:
'jupyter notebook'
This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

#### Open the Notebook:
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the .ipynb file and click on it to open.

#### Run the Notebook:
Inside the notebook, you can run individual cells by selecting them and either clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.
